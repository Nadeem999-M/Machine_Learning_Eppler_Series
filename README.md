# Machine_Learning_Eppler_Series
This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and generate optimized airfoil geometries based on Eppler series data. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, performance analysis using XFLR5, feature engineering, neural network training in MATLAB, and deployment through a custom GUI for airfoil geometry prediction.
